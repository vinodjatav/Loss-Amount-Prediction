# Loss-Amount-Prediction
I have created a sample dataset named "dataset_file.csv" that contains 2 coloumns basically Date and Loss amount for different insurance companies.Firstly, I loaded the dataset, then I graphically displayed the data in histogram form using matplotlib library.The output of which is shown in output 1.png.  Inorder to predict the loss amount using the historical trends I have used LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)approach. LSTMs are widely used for sequence prediction problems and have proven to be extremely effective. The reason they work so well is because LSTM is able to store past information that is important, and forget the information that is not. LSTM has three gates:  The input gate: The input gate adds information to the cell state The forget gate: It removes the information that is no longer required by the model. The output gate: Output Gate at LSTM selects the information to be shown as output.  The output is shown in a graphical format where the orange coloured scale in the histogram represents the predicted output. The final predicted amount along with the original amount is shown graphically in output 2.png.
